				<h1>Hack Western - An Evaluation</h1>		

			</div>

			<div id="introduction" class="qualifications-page">

				<h2>Introduction</h2>

				<p>Hack Western is an annual hackathon event that takes place at Western University. I had the opportunity to volunteer for Hack Western 5 in 2018. This was my first Hackathon and I learned a lot in the process. Throughout my time volunteering, I noticed some things could be improved on in the future to make the experience for all volunteers, hackers, sponsors, and mentors better. This evaluation highlights my observations and recommendations that could be implemented in future Hackathons to make the experience better for all attendees.</p>

			</div>

			
			<div id="communication" class="qualifications-page">
			
				<h2>Communication</h2>

				<h3>Observations</h3>

				<p>While volunteers were informed of what they needed to do in their specified assigned tasks, many volunteers were not aware where events or rooms were located (e.g. sleeping rooms or where group formation was). Many attendees including hackers and sponsors approached numerous volunteers for directions and volunteers were not able to assist them due to not being informed themselves about the locations of these events and rooms. Volunteers had to direct these participants to organizers who, at times, were not in the immediate area. Consequently, participants spent upwards of 5-10 minutes at times for assistance which potentially caused them to feel like their experience at Hack Western 5 was not the best it could have been.</p>

				<h3>Recommendations</h3>

				<p>In the future, volunteer coordinators could set aside one or two days before the event to walk around the venue (referred to as “orientation”) with all the volunteers to discuss where important locations in the building are (e.g. sleeping rooms, food/drink areas, major activities like team formation, and so on). This would not only allow volunteers to know their way around the venue before the event, but it would also result in other participants having a better experience at Hack Western.</p>

				<p>In addition, this would be an excellent time to highlight where and when major activities at the Hackathon would be taking place. Not only does this allow volunteers to be of more assistance to attendees, but it also makes volunteers feel more connected to the event itself.</p>

				<h2>Organization</h2>

				<h3>Observations</h3>

				<p>Volunteers were provided a schedule of their assigned shifts, which was excellent to provide. However, during these shifts many volunteers were lost in the sense that they did not know what to do - in fact, many simply would wait for directives from the organizers. Volunteers were provided with a list of duties; yet no volunteers were given definitive duties that corresponded to the document. This led to confusion which in turn resulted in a lower than expected efficiency of work and decreased the morale of volunteers.

				<p>Furthermore, the first shift of volunteers could be handled in a more efficient and effective manner. Many volunteers had their first shifts during busy times; this meant many organizers were not available to give a briefing to the volunteer. There was an instance where a volunteer waited 10-15 minutes after arriving in the building, unable to start their shift because they were waiting for an organizer to bring them up to speed. This is inefficient and causes volunteers to feel that their time and efforts are undervalued and not being used in an impactful way. Some volunteers were assigned duties that they felt was a waste of their time and abilities (e.g. standing by the main entrance stairs); this made volunteers more unlikely to want to come back for more shifts.</p>

				<h3>Recommendations</h3>

				<p>In the future, it may be beneficial to assign duties to volunteers beforehand. This could be done in the same way volunteer schedules were provided. Providing assigned duties would allow volunteers to be aware of the duties they would be doing, all while ensuring that organizers are being efficient with the time of volunteers and putting it to good use. When volunteers are less in need, ensure their jobs are well defined and provided; conversely, when volunteers are more in need, assign floaters to handle these duties but note it in a schedule.</p>

				<p>While events as large as Hackathon will have unexpected circumstances, volunteers should be provided with their expected schedules and duties well in advance. This is not to say that in times of needs volunteers can be asked to do other duties. However, organizers should try to try to provide these two things to increase awareness of our volunteers and to ensure their time is used effectively. With this in mind, give volunteers the opportunity to choose their duties (within reason); this ensures that volunteers are happy and increases overall morale.</p>

				<p>Furthermore, volunteers should be provided with their shirts and lanyards during orientation. This will ensure that when volunteers arrive for their shift, they are immediately prepared to do their duties and will not need to wait for an organizer to brief them. This frees up more times for organizers and volunteers, allowing the time to be used in a more meaningful way.</p>

			</div>

			<div id="feedback" class="qualifications-page">

				<h2>Feedback</h2>

				<h3>Observations</h3>

				<p>After the event, there was no opportunity for volunteers to provide their feedback. Volunteers have a very important role in the operations of Hackathon and are interacting with everyone at the event; they also have done many duties and are able to provide invaluable input for future events. Organizers of events as large as this one should always try to improve the experience for all members; allowing volunteers to give their feedback is essential to making Hack Western better in future years.</p>

				<h3>Recommendations</h3>

				<p>In the future, create a feedback form and send it to all volunteers after the event. This form can be brief, but should be meaningful.</p>

			<div id="conclusion" class="qualifications-page">

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>

				<p>Hack Western 5 was a success, but there is always room for improvement. This year, the lack of communication and organization in some areas resulted in time and resources being inefficiently used. Furthermore, it led to the decreased motivation and productivity of volunteers which had a direct impact on hackers, sponsors, and mentors.</p>
